				<p>		BOXES SOLVED!<br>
						There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.

						Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
						Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 
						Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
						<br>
						<span><strong>Box Positioning</strong></span><br>
						Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
						Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behaviour and let divs appear next to each other.
						<br>
						<span><strong>GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND</strong></span><br>
						understanding the syntax of the answer is difficult in the novice stage, but becomes easier quickly with familiarity.
						further complications are added, learning a new editor (or any editor) the incongruity of the material being provided and
						learning how to think about top down, it must be very difficult if you have never done anything like this before.
						I have 30 years  of experience to tap into, I feel for the true newbie. keep at it, it gets easier.

			<span>using programming languages vs common language</span><br>
		  </div> <!-- concept-title -->
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="concept-description">
				<span><strong>Ambiguity</strong></span><br>
				<span>Common languages contain things like 'english' or spin or body language or context. Programming languages seek to remove all those ambiguous parts of communication. Our goal in using programming language is not to communicate ideas, but to command a machine to do exactly as it is told, without question and without comment.
				</span><br><br>
				<span><strong>Verbosity</strong></span><br>
				<span>Using programming languages presents different limits on the nature and amount of verbs for that language. I think all verbs are singular in programming languages although the same singular verb can be executed multiple times in a particular line of code using control structures.
				</span><br><br>
				<p><strong>Elements of Grammar</strong></p>
					<p>
						Non-terminal -=> Replacement<br>
						A sentence is non terminal -=> sub verb object<br>
						The goal of programming languages is to replace non-terminals with terminals<br>
						grammar seeks to provide a large language with a small set of rules.<br>

							Recursive Grammar Definition:<br>
							expression -=> expression operator expression<br>
							expression -=> number<br>
							operator -=> +<br>
							operator -=> *<br>
							number -=> 0, 1, ...<br>
							<br>
							Example Derivation<br>
							expression -=> expression operator expression<br>
							expression -=>  1 	   + or *	       1<br>
							expression -=>  1      + or *    (expression)<br>
