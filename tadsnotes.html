				<span>Repetition:<br>
					According to Martin Fowler of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/repetition.pdf">ieee software </a>its a nice easy 3 page read. The concept (written about after 1996 when I began to learn html and and way after 1981 when I first began programming) is a thing called DRY (dont repeat yourself). He goes on to talk about patterns and good design of programs. In Summary, common tasks should be examples of DRY. <q>Thinking in terms of duplication and its problems also helps you understand the benefits of patterns.</q>

				<p>		BOXES SOLVED!<br>
						There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.

						Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
						Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 
						Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
						<br>
						<span><strong>Box Positioning</strong></span><br>
						Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
						Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behaviour and let divs appear next to each other.
						<br>
						<span><strong>GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND</strong></span><br>
						understanding the syntax of the answer is difficult in the novice stage, but becomes easier quickly with familiarity.
						further complications are added, learning a new editor (or any editor) the incongruity of the material being provided and
						learning how to think about top down, it must be very difficult if you have never done anything like this before.
						I have 30 years  of experience to tap into, I feel for the true newbie. keep at it, it gets easier.

					<span>the question put before us was to compute the amount of mins in 7 weeks. udacity did not recognize my answer as correct. I will present it here now:</span><br>

							weeks = 7<br>
							days = 7<br>
							hours = 24<br>
							mins = 60<br>
							time = weeks * days * hours * mins<br>
							print 'The amount of time we have to complete this section of the course is ', time, 'minutes.'<br>

							# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second<br>

							one meter is 100 centimeters<br>

			<span>using programming languages vs common language</span><br>
		  </div> <!-- concept-title -->

			<div class="concept-description">
				<span><strong>Ambiguity</strong></span><br>
				<span>Common languages contain things like 'english' or spin or body language or context. Programming languages seek to remove all those ambiguous parts of communication. Our goal in using programming language is not to communicate ideas, but to command a machine to do exactly as it is told, without question and without comment.
				</span><br><br>
				<span><strong>Verbosity</strong></span><br>
				<span>Using programming languages presents different limits on the nature and amount of verbs for that language. I think all verbs are singular in programming languages although the same singular verb can be executed multiple times in a particular line of code using control structures.

			<span>Procedural Thinking </span><br>
		  </div> <!-- concept-title -->
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				Functions or procedures, while initially adding to complexity, reduces coding repetition. In the future when I have a library of code and the familiarity with that library coding efficiency will increase. I will recall that I already have written a particular code block to compare which numbers are smallest and which are largest and just copy and paste my already written code into the current project and move on down the road.<br><br>
				
				Breaking procedures down to their elementary blocks is useful for solving big problems. For example our code 'bigger' that only takes two parameters can be used to find the result of any number of parameters and still yield one result; the biggest of that list.<br><br>
				
				Making functions is thinking about the logic and steps required to complete a task. Example, given a list of numbers find the greatest value in that list and return it.<br><br>
				
				Using the list is calling that function to find the value from a given list.<br><br>
				
				Return statements in functions are not required. Data can be manipulated and acted upon without a procedure returning a value. However, returning values from a procedure provides data that can be tested against and provides clarity in our coding with expected results.

				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						This is pretty damn cool!! Lists and lists of lists is a super cool concept. The ability to change a list element at any time presents amazing possibilities including constructing databases, web scraping info and delivering an entire web page by issuing the command print page[0]<br><br>
						
						Mutability or the ability to mutate a list provides amazing power that is at the root level of the language. the three most basic commands in programming; add, change, delete on the elements of list makes my head spin with glee.<br><br>
						
						However, there is cause for concern. With great power, comes great responsibility and that is illustrated in the difference between 'append' and +. A programmer needs to pay special attention to appending a list to a list. This will not add each individual item of the list, it will add 1 element, the list!<br><br>
